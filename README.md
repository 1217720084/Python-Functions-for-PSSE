Some Pythons functions to call PSS/E for power system simulation and analysis

This respository is to gather some useful Python functions and use cases for PSS/E.
Python can be used to call PSS/E and do simulations without open PSS/E.

History:

A simple use case (BasicExample.py) is added to show how to write up Python scripts to call PSS/E, load .sav file, calculate power flow, and do dynamic simulation.
